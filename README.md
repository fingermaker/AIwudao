Type Experiments with PoseNet
=================

![Interactive Gesture](https://cdn.glitch.com/2265e14a-84d1-435d-b7d7-6cf94be2325b%2Fdemo.gif)

An interactive type projection that utilizes simple body tracking from [Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)
and Reynolds' Flocking algorithm made accessible by the Coding Train's [Example](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/124-flocking-boids.html). 

Use your hands to distort the type. Walk away from the camera and watch the type disappear. 
Try it out [here](https://pose.yee.gd) or remix the code [on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pose).
